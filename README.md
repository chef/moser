erchef couch migration tool

This tool migrates data from the couchdb data schema used by various
versions of chef to the sql schema used by chef. 

This is named in honor of Leo Moser who first formulated the moving
sofa problem. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moving_sofa_problem. 
Hopefully moving this couch will be easier.
